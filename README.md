## This repository

All the code examples given in the lessons will be placed in this repository.
The repository is divided to folders according to every lesson we will have.

## Prerequisites

To teach advanced topics in angular, certain assumptions about student knowledge have to be taken into consideration.
I'm assuming you have the following experience with Angular:

- I know how to write typescript code and ES6+ Javascript
- I know HTML and CSS
- I have basic experience with angular, where I created Components, Directives, Services and Modules
- I also dealt with forms in my angular applications
- I deal with routing in my angular applications.
- I dealt with basic RXJS where I subscribed to Observables

## Additional Material

Each lesson is placed in its own folder.
Each folder you will find a directory called **slides**
That directory will contain pdf slides summary of the lesson.

All the lectures are recorded and available in this link:

Additional angular lectures are available in my youtube channel:

## Lectures format

In every lesson folder there is a **README.md** 
At the bottom of the file there is ex to practice every lesson.
After every lesson we have 1 hour to practice what we learned in the lesson.
Some of the ex I will show the solution.
The ex are very relevant to almost any angular app you will do so it is very important to do all the ex.
1 Hour won't be enough to complete all the ex. so some will be left for homework ex.
